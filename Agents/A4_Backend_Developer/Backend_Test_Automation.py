"This script sets up a test suite using Python's built-in unittest framework."
"It contains three test methods as placeholders for unit, integration,"
"and end-to-end tests. "
"You should replace these methods with your actual test methods and assertions."
"You should also import your backend application modules"
"and any additional testing frameworks required for your project."
