# This script is Agent 7 - Machine Learning Engineer
"""
This script is for the Machine Learning Engineer agent. It is responsible for developing and deploying machine learning models and integrating them with applications.

The script has the following steps:

1. Develop machine learning models
2. Deploy machine learning models
3. Integrate machine learning models with applications
