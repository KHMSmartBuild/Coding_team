Filename: code_formatting_and_linting.py

Description: A script that automatically formats your code according 
to a specific style guide and checks for common programming issues 
using linters like pylint, flake8, or black.

Typical uses: This script can be used to enforce code style consistency
 across the project and help identify potential issues in the code.

Typical locations: This script can be saved in the project's root directory
