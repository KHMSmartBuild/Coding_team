    Description: A script that runs your project's unit tests 
    and generates a report of test results, code coverage, 
    and other testing metrics.

    Typical uses: This script can be used to automate the process 
    of running unit tests and gathering test results, making it 
    easier to track the quality of your codebase over time.

    Typical locations: This script can be saved in the project's 
    root directory or in a "scripts" or "utilities" folder.

    Purpose and functions: The purpose of this script is to facilitate 
    the execution of unit tests and the collection of test results 
    and metrics, helping to ensure that the codebase 
    remains reliable and robust.

    Please note that this example is for a Python project using 
    pytest and pytest-cov. Modify the script accordingly for 
    your project's specific needs.
