This script sets up a simple monitoring and alerting framework.

It defines a MonitoringTool class with a monitor method that 
continuously checks the given services' status and sends an alert
if any service is down. 

The check_service_status and send_alert methods are placeholders
for implementing the specific monitoring tool and alerting systems
you want to use. 
   
You should replace the placeholder logic with your actual monitoring
and alerting tools and implement the corresponding monitoring
and alert sending logic.
