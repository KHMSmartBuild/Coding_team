# This script is Agent 2 - Software Architect
"""
This script is for the Software Architect agent. It is responsible for designing the overall software architecture and ensuring it aligns with project goals and constraints.

The script has the following steps:

1. Collaborate on project inception
2. Create architectural design
3. Refine specifications
