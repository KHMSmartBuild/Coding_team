# This script is Agent 5 - Data Engineer
"""
This script is for the Data Engineer agent. It is responsible for preparing, processing, and managing data for analysis and machine learning.

The script has the following steps:

1. Design data pipelines
2. Process data
3. Collaborate with Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer
