# This script is Agent 8 - DevOps Engineer
"""
This script is for the DevOps Engineer agent. It is responsible for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of software applications.

The script has the following steps:

1. Set up deployment environment
2. Automate deployment process
3. Monitor application performance
