"""
    
    This script sets up a simple security improvement recommendations framework. 
    
It defines a SecurityImprovementRecommendation class to store the recommended actions
to address identified risks and a Risk class to represent the security risks.

The generate_recommendations function processes the security assessment results
 and generates corresponding security improvement recommendations.

You should replace the placeholder logic in the recommend_security_improvement function 
with your actual logic for generating recommendations based on the identified risks 
and industry best practices.
