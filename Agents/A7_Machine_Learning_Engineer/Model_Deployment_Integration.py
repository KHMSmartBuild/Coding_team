"This script sets up a simple model deployment and integration"
"framework using the scikit-learn library and pickle for serialization."
"It defines a ModelDeployer class with methods to save, load,"
"and make predictions with a trained machine learning model. "
"You should replace the placeholder logic with your actual machine "
"learning model and deployment tools, such as Flask or FastAPI for creating APIs"
"and integrating the models with the relevant applications."
