"""
This script sets up a simple security assessment framework. 

It defines a SecurityAssessment class with a perform_security_assessment method
    that scans the given targets using the specified security testing tools.
The SecurityTestingTool class is a placeholder for implementing
    the specific security testing tools you want to use.
You should replace the placeholder logic with your actual security
    testing tools and implement the corresponding scanning logic.
